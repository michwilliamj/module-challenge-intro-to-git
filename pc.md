## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
    Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? 
    Git is stored locally and GitHub is exclusively cloudbased.
3. Why do we create a branch? 
    Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? 
    Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. 
    A quick way of switching branch on Git is to use the “git switch” command and specify the name of the branch you want to switch to.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 
    The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. 
    The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. 
    The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
7. What is a merge conflict? 
    A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? 
    When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge commits without your help.
